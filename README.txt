# Tantares-TweakScale-Configs
A repository for up-to-date Tantares and TantaresLV TweakScale configs!

README:

1. Drop Tantares_TweakScale.cfg in your /GameData/Tantares/ folder among the other configs.
2. Drop TantaresLV_TweakScale.cfg in your GameData/TantaresLV folder among the other configs.
3. Delete the Tantares_TweakScale.cfg in the GameData/TweakScale/patches folder. 
4. (Semi-optional) Go to /GameData/TweakScale/ScaleExponents.cfg, scroll down to the very bottom, and change noScaledCrewPods = 1 to noScaledCrewPods = 0

Enjoy!

Please PM me on the KSP forums for support. Do NOT go to Beale for support, as he's not the config author.

Feedback is also welcome. :)
